## üìä Diagram Formats

All diagrams use **Mermaid** syntax, which renders natively in:
- ‚úÖ GitHub
- ‚úÖ GitLab
- ‚úÖ VS Code (with Mermaid extension)
- ‚úÖ Notion
- ‚úÖ Obsidian
- ‚úÖ Most modern markdown viewers

### Viewing Options

**Option 1: GitHub/GitLab**
Simply view the `.md` files - diagrams render automatically

**Option 2: VS Code**
1. Install "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension
2. Open any diagram file
3. Press `Cmd+Shift+V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows)

**Option 3: Online Mermaid Editor**
1. Copy diagram code blocks
2. Paste into [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live)
3. Export as PNG/SVG if needed

## üîÑ Diagram Update Policy

These diagrams should be updated when:
- [ ] New sections or features are added
- [ ] Database schema changes
- [ ] Technology stack changes
- [ ] API routes are added/modified
- [ ] User flow changes significantly
- [ ] New integrations are added

**Update Process**:
1. Edit the Mermaid code in the relevant `.md` file
2. Test rendering in VS Code or GitHub preview
3. Update related documentation if needed
4. Commit with descriptive message: `docs: update [diagram name] for [change]`
