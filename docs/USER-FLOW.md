## Error Handling

### Validation Failures

**Invalid Dates:**
```
User: June 40th to 45th

Agent: I notice those dates aren't valid. June only has 30 days.
       Could you provide your travel dates? For example: June 15-19
```

**Over Budget:**
```
Agent: ‚ö†Ô∏è Budget Alert
       Your selections total ‚Ç¨2,500, which is above your stated budget of ‚Ç¨2,000.
       
       Would you like to:
       ‚Ä¢ Remove the spa package (-‚Ç¨300)
       ‚Ä¢ Choose a 3-star hotel instead (-‚Ç¨400)
       ‚Ä¢ Proceed anyway
```

**Incomplete Profile:**
```
User: Show me destinations

Agent: I'd love to! But I need a bit more information first:
       
       ‚óã Budget range (still needed)
       ‚óã Travel duration (still needed)
       
       What's your approximate budget per person?
```

**Invalid Email:**
```
User: My email is john@emailcom

Agent: That email format doesn't look quite right. 
       Could you double-check? It should be something like: name@domain.com
```

---

### User Corrections

**Modifying Previous Sections:**

```
User: Actually, I want to change my budget to luxury

Agent: No problem! Updating your budget to luxury.
       
       Would you like me to refresh the destination recommendations 
       based on this change?

User: Yes please

[Agent recalculates and shows new recommendations]
```

**Changing Destination Mid-Flow:**

```
User: Can I switch to Paris instead?

Agent: Of course! Let me update your selection to Paris.
       
       The trip details we collected (June 15-19) will still apply.
       Let me show you Paris packages that match your interests...

[Continues from Section 3 with new destination]
```

### System Errors

**GPT-5 Failure:**
```
System: [Retry 3 times with exponential backoff]
If still failing: "I'm having trouble processing that right now. 
                  Could you try rephrasing?"
```

**Database Error:**
```
System: "We're experiencing technical difficulties. 
         Your progress has been saved. Please try again in a moment."
[Log error for debugging]
