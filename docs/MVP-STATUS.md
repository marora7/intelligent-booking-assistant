## 🧪 Testing the MVP

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd /Users/manaliarora/Documents/node-booking-system
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Browser
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000

### 3. Test Section 1 (Profile Gathering)

**Test Conversation:**
```
You: "We're a couple interested in art museums and good food"
Agent: (extracts interests, asks follow-up questions)

You: "Mid-range budget, around 4-5 days"
Agent: (extracts budget and duration)

You: "We'd like to go in June, relaxed pace"
Agent: (extracts season and pace)

You: "We prefer warm weather"
Agent: (completes profile, shows summary)
→ "Perfect! I have all your preferences... Ready to see your personalized destination recommendations?"
```

### 4. Test Section 2 (Recommendations)

**Continue Conversation:**
```
You: "Yes, show me destinations"
Agent: (displays top 5 recommendations)

🥇 Florence (92% match)

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Section 3 & 4 not implemented yet** - Shows placeholder message
2. **No OpenAI integration** - Using keyword-based extraction (works well for MVP!)
3. **Destination selection** - Can say "book" but doesn't select specific city yet
4. **No images** - Destinations shown as text only

### Future Enhancements
- Add OpenAI for better NLP
- Add destination images
- Implement package selection UI
- Add activity selection
- Add booking confirmation flow
- Add email notifications

## 💾 Database Status

### Tables
- ✅ destinations (37 records with interest scores)
- ✅ attractions (320 records)
- ✅ activities (320 records)
- ✅ packages (56 records)
- ✅ restaurants (240 records)
